    "## Factory Method Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Type:__ Creational\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★★☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★☆☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "Imagine you're building an application that needs to work with different types of database connections. Initially, you might directly create specific database connection objects in your code. However, this approach ties your code to specific database implementations, making it difficult to switch databases or add new ones without modifying existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls with calls to a special factory method. Objects returned from a factory method are often referred to as \"products\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern extracts the object creation code into a separate method (factory method) defined in an interface. Subclasses can override this method to change the type of products created."

    "        A construction company can be seen as a factory that creates buildings. Different departments (subclasses) within the company might specialize in different types of buildings - residential homes, office buildings, or industrial facilities. The company follows a common blueprint process (interface), but each department implements the process differently to create specific types of buildings.\n",

    "2. Restaurant Kitchen:\n",
    "        A restaurant kitchen prepares different types of dishes through a standard process (order receipt, preparation, cooking, plating). Different chef stations (subclasses) handle different categories of food items (pasta, grills, salads) but follow the same overall process interface."
