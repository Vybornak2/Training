    "## Singleton Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Type:__ Creational\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★★★__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★☆☆☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Singleton__ is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:\n",
    "1. **Ensuring a class has just a single instance**: This is useful when you need strict control over global variables or shared resources like a database connection, file system, or configuration settings. For example, multiple parts of your code may need to access a shared database connection, but creating multiple connections could lead to inconsistent data or resource waste.\n",
    "2. **Providing a global access point to that instance**: Global variables can be accessed from anywhere, which is convenient but breaks encapsulation. The Singleton provides controlled access to the sole instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Singleton pattern makes the default constructor private to prevent other objects from instantiating the Singleton class directly. It provides a static creation method that acts as a constructor, caches the first created object, and returns that cached object for all subsequent calls."
