# Creational Patterns Overview

Creational design patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Factory Method

- __Popularity: ★★★★☆__
- __Complexity: ★★☆☆☆__

### Intent:
__Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Abstract Factory

- __Popularity: ★★★☆☆__
- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__

### Intent:
__Abstract Factory__ is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Builder

- __Popularity: ★★★☆☆__
- __Complexity: ★★☆☆☆__

### Intent:
__Builder__ is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Prototype

- __Popularity: ★★☆☆☆__
- __Complexity: ★☆☆☆☆__

### Intent:
__Prototype__ is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Singleton

- __Popularity: ★★★★★__
- __Complexity: ★☆☆☆☆__

### Intent:
__Singleton__ is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Object Pool

- __Popularity: ★★☆☆☆__
- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__

### Intent:
__Object Pool__ is a creational design pattern that uses a set of initialized objects kept ready to use, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand.
