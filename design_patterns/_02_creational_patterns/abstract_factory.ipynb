    "## Abstract Factory Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Type:__ Creational\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Abstract Factory__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "When an application needs to create multiple related objects that work together, it becomes important to ensure these objects are compatible. For example, in a UI toolkit, buttons, checkboxes, and windows must share a consistent look and feel (e.g., Windows vs. macOS style). Creating these objects independently risks inconsistency, especially when new product families are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Abstract Factory pattern suggests creating an interface for a factory of related objects. Each concrete implementation of this factory creates objects belonging to a specific family or theme. The client code works with these factories and products through their abstract interfaces, allowing you to change the concrete factory without altering the client code."

    "    A furniture company might make different styles of furniture (modern, Victorian, Art Deco). Each style includes matching chairs, sofas, and tables that share design elements. The abstract factory is like the company's production system, with separate concrete factories for each furniture style. These factories ensure that when you order a Victorian chair, you can also get a matching Victorian table.\n",
