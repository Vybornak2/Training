    "## Object Pool\n",

    "- __Type:__ Creational\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★☆☆☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Object Pool__ is a creational design pattern that manages a pool of reusable objects to improve performance and resource utilization. It allows clients to \"borrow\" objects from the pool, use them, and return them to the pool instead of creating and destroying objects repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "Creating and destroying objects, especially those that are expensive to initialize (like database connections, thread objects, or network connections), can be resource-intensive and harm performance. When these objects are needed frequently but for short periods, the overhead of initialization and destruction becomes significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there may be scenarios where we need to limit the number of objects that can exist at any given time to manage resources effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Object Pool pattern maintains a set of initialized objects ready for use, rather than allocating and destroying them on demand. When a client needs an object, it requests one from the pool. If a free object is available, it is returned. When the client is done with the object, it returns it to the pool rather than destroying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern typically involves a pool manager class that maintains two collections of objects: available and in-use. The manager handles the logic for acquiring, releasing, and potentially creating new objects when needed. The reusable objects themselves usually implement a reset method to clear their state before being reused."

    "\n",
    "1. Library system:\n",
    "   A library maintains a collection of books that can be borrowed by readers. Instead of buying a new book every time you want to read something, you borrow a book from the library, read it, and return it so others can use it too. The library is the object pool, and the books are the reusable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Car rental service:\n",
    "   A car rental company maintains a fleet of cars that customers can rent. When a customer needs a car, they rent one from the available pool. When they're done, they return the car to the rental company, which resets it (cleans, refuels) before making it available to the next customer. The rental company is the object pool, and the cars are the reusable objects."

    "- Python's garbage collection handles memory management automatically, but Object Pool is still valuable for expensive-to-create resources\n",

    "- Libraries like `dbutils.pooled_db` for database connection pooling and `multiprocessing.Pool` for process pooling implement this pattern\n",
