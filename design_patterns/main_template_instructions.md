# Template for Main Design Pattern Documentation File

This template provides instructions for creating the main documentation file that will serve as an index for all design patterns. The main file should provide concise overviews of each pattern with links to detailed documentation files. All information should be tailored for Python developers, focusing on the specific implementations and nuances of design patterns in Python.

## Purpose of the Main File
- To serve as a central hub for all design pattern documentation
- To provide quick reference information on each pattern
- To allow easy comparison of patterns by popularity and complexity

## Content Structure for Each Pattern
Use the following template for each design pattern entry in the main file. Each entry should be brief but informative, with a link to the detailed documentation.

## Rating System
Popularity and complexity ratings should reflect the pattern's usage and difficulty level specifically within the Python programming language:
- Popularity: ★☆☆☆☆ (rarely used) to ★★★★★ (very commonly used)
- Complexity: ★☆☆☆☆ (very simple) to ★★★★★ (very complex)


```markdown
## Pattern_Name

- __Popularity: ★★★☆☆__
- __Complexity: ★★☆☆☆__

### Intent:
__Pattern Name__ is a [type] design pattern that [concise description of intent]. (Example: __Factory Method__ is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.)
