    "- __Type:__ Behavioral\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★★☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__State Pattern__ is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class."

    "### Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need an object to behave differently depending on its internal state, and the number of states and state transitions could be substantial, making conditional statements complex and error-prone. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing object behavior that depends on numerous internal states becomes unwieldy with conditional logic\n",
    "- State transitions and rules become scattered throughout the code\n",
    "- Adding new states requires modifying multiple conditional blocks\n",
    "- The resulting code is difficult to maintain and extend"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The State pattern suggests creating state-specific classes for each possible state of an object and extracting all state-specific behaviors into these classes. The context (original object) maintains a reference to the current state object and delegates all state-specific behavior to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state\n",
    "- **State Interface**: Defines an interface common to all ConcreteState classes\n",
    "- **Concrete States**: Each implements behavior associated with a particular state\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior and makes state transitions explicit. Adding new states becomes as simple as creating new classes that implement the State interface."
