    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Template Method__ is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure."

    "### Problem:\n",
    "Imagine you're creating various applications with similar processing logic but with differences in specific implementation details. You find yourself duplicating code across classes, which leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code duplication when implementing similar algorithms\n",
    "- Difficulty maintaining consistency across implementations\n",
    "- Changes to the core algorithm structure requiring updates in multiple places\n",
    "- Inability to enforce a standard sequence of operations while allowing customization\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this pattern, you would end up with redundant code across classes that perform similar operations with minor variations."

   "source": [
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Template Method pattern solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class method (the \"template method\")\n",
    "- Breaking the algorithm into steps represented by methods\n",
    "- Implementing common steps in the base class\n",
    "- Declaring abstract methods for steps that must be implemented by subclasses\n",
    "- Optionally providing hooks (methods with default implementations that subclasses can override)\n",
    "\n",
    "The base class controls the overall algorithm structure, while subclasses provide specific implementations for varying steps, creating a clean separation between the algorithm's structure and its implementation details."

    "### Python-specific implementation notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's `abc` module provides the `ABC` class and `@abstractmethod` decorator for creating abstract base classes and methods\n",
    "- Unlike some languages, Python allows calling methods of a superclass directly using `super()`, making it easier to extend functionality while reusing code\n",
    "- Python's duck typing allows alternative implementations where the template pattern could be used with composition instead of inheritance\n",
    "- Python's higher-order functions and decorators offer additional ways to implement template-like patterns\n",
    "- The standard library's `collections.abc` provides abstract base classes that follow template pattern principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### Related patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strategy Pattern: Template Method uses inheritance to vary parts of an algorithm, while Strategy uses composition to change the entire algorithm\n",
    "- Factory Method: Often used within Template Methods to create objects whose type is determined by subclasses\n",
    "- Hook Method: A specialized form of Template Method that focuses on providing extension points\n",
    "- Command Pattern: Can use Template Methods to implement common command processing with specific command execution logic"
