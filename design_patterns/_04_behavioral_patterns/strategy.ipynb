    "When you need to use different variations of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A sorting application might need multiple sorting algorithms based on data size or type\n",
    "- Different payment methods in an e-commerce system\n",
    "- Various compression algorithms for different file types\n",
