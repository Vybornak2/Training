    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "__Command__ is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations."
   ]

   "source": [
    "### Problem:\n",
    "You need to decouple an object that invokes an operation from the provider that actually performs it. You might also need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameterize objects with operations to be performed\n",
    "- Queue operations for later execution\n",
    "- Support undoing operations\n",
    "- Store a history of commands for auditing or logging\n",
    "- Implement callback functionality in a structured way\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Command pattern suggests encapsulating a request as an object. The key idea is to extract all the request details (the object being called, the name of the method, and the list of arguments) into a separate command class with a single method that triggers this request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic objects. From now on, the GUI object doesn't need to know what business logic object will receive the request and how it'll be processed. The GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern introduces several components:\n",
    "- **Command**: The interface that declares the execute method\n",
    "- **ConcreteCommand**: Implements the Command interface and defines binding between a Receiver object and an action\n",
    "- **Client**: Creates and configures concrete command objects\n",
    "- **Invoker**: Asks the command to carry out the request\n",
    "- **Receiver**: Knows how to perform the operation associated with the command"

The order slip contains all details needed to prepare the dish. The chef executes the order and the waiter doesn't need to know how the food is prepared. The order can be queued if the chef is busy, and could theoretically be \"undone\" if the customer changes their mind before preparation begins.\n",
