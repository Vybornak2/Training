    "# Proxy Pattern\n",

    "- __Type:__ Structural\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★★☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Control access to the original object\n",
    "- Add functionality when accessing the object\n",
    "- Delay the creation and initialization of expensive objects until needed\n",
    "- Implement access control for the original object's clients"
   ]

   "source": [
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes direct access to an object isn't possible or desirable for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The object might be expensive to create or use (memory, computation, etc.)\n",
    "- The object might require access control (authorization, authentication)\n",
    "- The object might be remote, and network operations need to be managed\n",
    "- You might need additional behavior before/after accessing the real object\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the Proxy pattern, clients would need to manage these concerns themselves, leading to code duplication and tight coupling between clients and the service objects."
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Proxy pattern suggests creating a new proxy class with the same interface as the original service object. The proxy maintains a reference to the service object and controls access to it by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating the service object only when it's really needed (lazy initialization)\n",
    "2. Checking access permissions before forwarding requests\n",
    "3. Logging requests or performing other tasks before/after forwarding\n",
    "4. Managing remote service interaction details (network communication)\n",
    "\n",
    "The proxy acts as a substitute for the real service object, allowing it to perform additional operations before or after passing the request to the original object."
