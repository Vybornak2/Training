    "## Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Decorator__ pattern is a structural design pattern that attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically without modifying their structure. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add responsibilities to objects dynamically\n",
    "- Provide flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality\n",
    "- Support the open/closed principle (open for extension, closed for modification)\n",
    "- Allow responsibilities to be withdrawn when no longer needed"

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need to add responsibilities or behaviors to individual objects rather than an entire class. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to add features to objects without changing their underlying code\n",
    "- You want to add combinations of features that would lead to an explosion of subclasses\n",
    "- You need to modify objects in ways that are not known at compile-time\n",
    "- You want to avoid creating a complex inheritance hierarchy just to support different feature combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "Using inheritance to extend functionality isn't always flexible enough. Inheritance is static and applies to an entire class."

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Decorator pattern solves these problems by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating a wrapper that implements the same interface as the original object\n",
    "2. Referencing the original object through composition\n",
    "3. Delegating operations to the wrapped object\n",
    "4. Adding its own behavior before or after delegating\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decorators can be stacked in any order to create complex combinations of behaviors\n",
    "- Decorators can be added and removed at runtime\n",
    "- The pattern follows the single responsibility principle by separating concerns into different classes\n",
    "- The client doesn't need to know about the specific decorators being used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "1. Same Interface\n",
    "    - Decorator objects should be designed to be interchangeable with the original object\n",
    "    - Decorator and the original object should implement the same interface\n",
    "    - Decorator should forward requests to the original object\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recursive Composition\n",
    "    - Decorators can be stacked on top of each other\n",
    "    - Decorators can wrap other decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Alternatives\n",
    "    - Monkey Patching objects at runtime\n",
    "    - Monkey Patching classes at runtime\n",

    "4. Additional resources\n",

    "  - Mixins (multiple inheritance)  \n",
