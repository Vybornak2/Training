    "## Intent\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimize memory usage by sharing common parts of state between objects\n",
    "- Support large numbers of similar objects efficiently\n",
    "- Separate intrinsic (shared) from extrinsic (unique) state\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When applications need to create a large number of similar objects, memory consumption can become a critical issue. Creating thousands or millions of individual objects with redundant data can quickly exhaust available memory and degrade performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A text editor needs to represent each character with its formatting (font, size, style)\n",
    "- A game world contains thousands of similar graphical elements (trees, particles)\n",
    "- A simulation tracks millions of particles that share many common properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a proper pattern to handle this scenario:\n",
    "- Memory usage grows linearly with the number of objects\n",
    "- Identical data is duplicated across many objects\n",
    "- Performance suffers due to excessive memory allocation and garbage collection"

    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flyweight pattern solves this problem by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object. The pattern separates object state into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intrinsic state**: Data that can be shared across multiple objects (immutable, context-independent)\n",
    "- **Extrinsic state**: Data that is unique to each object instance (mutable, context-specific)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flyweight**: Contains the intrinsic (shared) state that can be used across multiple contexts\n",
    "2. **FlyweightFactory**: Creates and manages flyweight objects, ensuring that flyweights are shared properly\n",
    "3. **Context**: Contains extrinsic state and references to flyweight objects\n",
    "4. **Client**: Computes or stores the extrinsic state and passes it to the flyweight when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern typically uses a factory to maintain a pool of existing flyweights, so they can be reused rather than creating new objects. When a client requests a flyweight, the factory either returns an existing instance or creates a new one if necessary."
