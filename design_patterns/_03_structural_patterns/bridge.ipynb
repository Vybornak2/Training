    "# Bridge Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Type:__ Structural\n",
    "- __Popularity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "- __Complexity: ★★★☆☆__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intent:\n",
    "Bridge pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It allows separation of concerns and enables both abstraction and implementation to evolve without affecting each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "When an abstraction can have multiple implementations, the traditional approach using inheritance leads to an explosion of classes, especially when both the abstraction and implementation dimensions need to vary independently. This creates tight coupling between abstractions and implementations, making the system difficult to extend and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have multiple types of UI controls (buttons, checkboxes, etc.) that need to work across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Web), creating a separate class for each combination (WindowsButton, MacButton, WebButton, etc.) leads to a proliferation of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Bridge pattern addresses this by separating the abstraction and implementation into separate class hierarchies and connecting them through composition rather than inheritance. This creates a \"bridge\" between the two hierarchies that allows them to vary independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components:\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: Defines the interface used by the client and maintains a reference to an Implementation object\n",
    "- **Refined Abstraction**: Extends the Abstraction interface\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Defines the interface for implementation classes\n",
    "- **Concrete Implementation**: Implements the Implementation interface"
