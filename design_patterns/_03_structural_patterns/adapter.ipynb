    "__Adapter__ is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping an instance of one class into a class with an interface expected by clients."

    "### Problem:\n",
    "Imagine you have a system with established interfaces, but you need to integrate a new component or library whose interface doesn't match what your system expects. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You're using a library that returns data in XML format, but your application works with JSON\n",
    "- You need to integrate a third-party payment gateway but its API doesn't match your payment processing interface\n",
    "- You're incorporating legacy code that cannot be modified, yet needs to work with your new system\n",

    "### Solution:\n",
    "The Adapter pattern suggests creating a special object (an adapter) that converts the interface of one object to match what another object expects. The adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary ways to implement the Adapter pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Adapter**: Uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another (less common in Python due to potential complications with multiple inheritance)\n",
    "2. **Object Adapter**: Uses composition to reference the adaptee object and implements the target interface (more commonly used in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern enables objects with incompatible interfaces to work together without modifying their source code."

    "- Type hints and abstract base classes (from the `abc` module) can clarify adapter interfaces\n",

    "- Proxy: Provides a surrogate for another object, controlling access to it; differs from Adapter in that it uses the same interface\n",
