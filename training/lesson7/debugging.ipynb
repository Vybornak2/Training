    "\n",
    "The simplest method is inserting `print()` statements to inspect variable values at different code points.\n",

    "**Usage:**\n",

    "# In debugging_example.py, inside calculate_average\n",
    "print(f\"DEBUG: numbers = {numbers}\")\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    print(f\"DEBUG: current num = {num}, type = {type(num)}\")\n",
    "    total += num\n",

    "**Pros:** Quick for simple issues.\n",
    "**Cons:** Can clutter code; becomes cumbersome for complex bugs; requires manual removal."

    "\n",
    "**Type Hints (e.g., `numbers: list[float | int]`)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Improve code readability; allow static analysis tools (e.g., MyPy) to catch type errors *before runtime*.\n",
    "- **Debugging Aid:** Clarify expected data types, helping to spot type-related bugs during development.\n",
    "- **Limitation:** Not enforced by Python at runtime by default. They don't prevent runtime `TypeError`s if incorrect types are passed.\n",

    "**Error Handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks)**:\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Gracefully manage errors that occur *at runtime*.\n",
    "- **Debugging Aid:** Can catch and log errors, providing context. Avoid overly broad `except Exception:` which can hide bugs.\n",
    "- **Necessity:** Crucial for robust code to handle unexpected inputs or states (e.g., `TypeError` with `data2`, `ZeroDivisionError` with `data3` in `debugging_example.py`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Synergy:**\n",
    "- Use type hints to define function contracts.\n",
    "- Use error handling (`if` checks for expected issues, `try-except` for unexpected ones) to manage runtime deviations from these contracts or external issues."
